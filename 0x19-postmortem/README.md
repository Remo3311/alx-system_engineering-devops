                                                Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on May 6, 2024


     Issue Summary:

- Duration: May 6, 2024, 09:00 AM - 11:30 AM (UTC)
- Impact: The primary service affected was our web application, resulting in intermittent downtime and slow performance for approximately 60% of users.
- Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic and overload on certain backend servers

    Timeline:

- 09:00 AM: Monitoring alerts detected performance degradation.
- 09:05 AM: Engineering team notified.
- 09:10 AM: Initial investigation on backend server health.
- 09:30 AM: Misleading assumption on database as bottleneck.
- 10:00 AM: Incident escalated to senior engineering team.
- 10:15 AM: Load balancer configurations reviewed.
- 10:30 AM: Load balancer settings adjusted.
- 11:00 AM: Services gradually restored.
- 11:30 AM: Incident resolved.

    Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was traced back to a misconfiguration in the load balancer, which was inadvertently routing a disproportionate amount of traffic to certain backend servers. This resulted in overload and performance degradation for those servers, impacting overall system stability. The issue was resolved by adjusting the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic, alleviating the strain on individual servers and restoring normal service operation.

   Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar outages in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented:
1. Automated Load Balancer Configuration Checks: Implement automated checks to ensure load balancer configurations adhere to best practices and evenly distribute traffic across backend servers.
2. Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting: Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time visibility into traffic distribution and server performance, enabling quicker detection and response to issues.
3. Regular Load Testing: Conduct regular load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify potential bottlenecks or misconfigurations before they impact production environments.
4. Documentation and Training: Document load balancer configuration procedures and provide training to relevant teams to ensure proper configuration practices are followed in the future.

    The conclusion:
 The outage stemmed from a load balancer misconfiguration, resolved through adjustments. Proposed measures aim to prevent future incidents, underscoring the need for swift implementation.
